This repository contains White box and Black box neural networks.

## White Box neural network:
        Simpler models such as linear regression and decision trees on the other hand provide less predictive capacity and are not always capable of modelling the inherent complexity of the dataset . They are however significantly easier to explain and interpret.
       
## Black box neural network:
        Black-box models such as neural networks, gradient boosting models or complicated ensembles often provide great accuracy. The inner workings of these models are harder to understand and they do not provide an estimate of the importance of each feature on the model predictions, nor is it easy to understand how the different features interact
